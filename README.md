A quiz game with dynamic features such as different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), a time limit for each question, multiple rounds of gameplay, and a leaderboard to track the best scores.
Key Features:

Difficulty Levels: Users can choose the difficulty level before starting the quiz. The game offers three levels: easy, medium, and hard, with questions tailored to each level.
Time Limit: Each question has a time limit for answering, tracked by a countdown timer. If the user takes too long, they are notified, and their score isn't affected for that round.
Multiple Rounds: Users can choose how many rounds they want to play in a session. After completing the rounds, their score and the total time taken are displayed.
Leaderboard: A leaderboard stores the top scores, along with the player's name, and ranks them based on performance. The leaderboard is updated at the end of each game session.
Randomized Questions: Questions are randomly selected from a set of predefined questions for each difficulty level, ensuring variety in gameplay.
Score Calculation: The userâ€™s score is incremented for each correct answer, and the total score is displayed at the end of the game session. Additionally, the total time taken to complete the quiz is calculated.
Multiple Rounds and Replay Option: After finishing the rounds, the user can choose to play again with a different difficulty or exit the game.
User Experience: The game engages the user by allowing them to select their preferred difficulty level, answering questions within a time limit, and playing multiple rounds. At the end of each game, the leaderboard is updated, giving users a sense of accomplishment and motivating them to try again. The game provides immediate feedback on whether the user's answers are correct or wrong, as well as the time taken for each response.

These two projects offer interactive, user-friendly applications that enhance basic Python skills such as input handling, control flow, randomization, and working with time-based functions and external data (leaderboard). Both programs also showcase the importance of error handling, user interaction, and smooth program flow to create a positive user experience.
